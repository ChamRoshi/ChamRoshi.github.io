## Data Journalism

### Problem
Propellernet & CarWow needed some eye catching and provocative data to hook journalists with. Following their creative lead, we build out a system to calculate how closely cars conform to the golden ratio. 

### Impact
By challenging assumptions and building eye catching visuals, the analysis netted over 100 backlinks and coverage in 15 national newspapers. The project was able to have the largest impact while minimising the amount of time spent manually assessing input images.

### Method
Using a combination of augmented tagging and computation optimised geometric analysis, this project was an interesting challenge with a successful result.
