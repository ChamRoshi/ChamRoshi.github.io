## Probability To Convert Modeling

### Problem
If you don't understand what makes a consumer more likely to convert, your marketing is likely to be directionless or driven by hunches and general heuristics. 

Understanding what behavioural actions make a user more likely to convert has a twofold benefit. Firstly, you can accurately target users that your actions will have the largest impact on. Secondly, you can understand what behavioural actions you should be driving users towards. 

### Impact
Adtech client - Optimised bidding algorithm, how much to spend against the marginal impact of a new session.
B2B client- Better understanding of what website sections & email types made users more likely to convert realigned the content team's strategy towards webinars. 

### Method
Flexible, gridsearched, GAM models were able to model the dynamic and semi-linear distributions of user behaviour accurately while also providing interrogatable prediction curves and smooth simulated responses for marginal impact analysis.
