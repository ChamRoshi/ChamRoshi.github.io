## Unknown-Unknown Business Analysis

### Problem
Businesses get stuck in ruts, it's in their interest to orientate onto simple logic and objectives. This means they will miss what their data might be telling them. 

Unknown-unknown business analysis taps into the underlying structures of the data itself to understand subtle and unexpected relationships, trends and heuristics that can offer new revenue channels and challenge current working patterns.

### Impact
B2B customer - Working with customer data for the last 2 years, I modeled trends, profitable dynamics and optimising strategies
SEO agency - Taking keyword data, I build out sub-topic spaces to suggest tangential and novel topics for keyword expansion

### Method
Unknown-unknown business analysis leverages unsupervised learning models such as encoder neural networks, non-Euclidean clustering and dimensionality reduction.
