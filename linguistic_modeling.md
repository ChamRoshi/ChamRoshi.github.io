title: "Linguistic Modelling At Scale"
permalink: /linguistic_modeling/

## Problem
Raw unstructured text data has high value for insight but is tough to work with. 

Buried within text data is;
* What your customers truly think of your products, 
* What your next product should do for your customers
* What the dominant zeitgeists are within your customers... and how they will progress in the future

## Impact
I've written 2 academic papers on this area that not only do the work of 2 weeks of 5 researchers time in half a day, I've also derived novel insights and understandings of social groups that had eluded identification from talented scholars. 

My research papers are: 
  * [Topic Modelling The Red Pill, 2018](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323666159_Topic_Modeling_The_Red_Pill)
  * [Creating Masculinities Online: Bronies and The Red Pill, 2015](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281448472_Creating_Masculinities_Online_Bronies_and_The_Red_Pill_-_JB_Mountford) 

Furthermore, I'm currently developing a research paper that not only models unknown topics within user groups, it also forecasts the popularity of these topics to better aid tactical planning to engage with these topics.

## Method
A generalised methodology follows this process that I manage and implement: 
  1. Data collection (web scraping or sql extraction)
  2. Data cleaning 
  3. Text cleaning (tokenizing, stopword filtering, part-of-speech filtering)
  4. Text modeling (dimensionality reduction, topic modeling, vector space embedding) 
  5. Model interrogation (answering the business question) 
  6. Reporting, insight sharing and action recommendations
